    <p>Here we give a step-by-step guide for installing and running 
Proofgold Core on a 64-bit Debian machine. Similar steps should work for
 other linux systems.</p>
    <p><b>Step 0.</b> Run a litecoin node. We will not describe this 
here, except to say the litecoin.conf file should contain lines giving 
values for rpcuser and rpcpass. Make sure the rpcpass is secure or 
someone may be able to control your litecoin node (spending any 
litecoins there to themselves). It is best practice to only allow local 
access to the litecoin node by including rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 in the 
litecoin.conf file. It is also possible to run litecoin and proofgold on
 different machines in which case an rpcallowip entry giving the ip of 
the proofgold node should be included in litecoin.conf.</p>
    <p><b>Step 1.</b> Install the prerequisites. You will need to do this with superuser privileges.<br><br>
    <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/apt-get-installdeps1.png"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 2.</b> Get and install the latest Zarith library for 
ocaml. In the screenshot below the make install may require superuser 
privileges. It is also possible to install Proofgold with a local 
installation of Zarith, though this may require editing the Proofgold 
Makefile (see Makefile.in) to give the path to Zarith.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/wget-zarith.png"><br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/tarxzvfzarith.png"><br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/Zarith-configure.png"><br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/zarithmake.png"><br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/zarithmakeinstall.png"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 3.</b> Get the latest version of Proofgold Core from <a href="">proofgold.org</a> and untar it. The screenshots below are for Proofgold 0.2.1, but make sure to get version 0.2.3 or later.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/wget-pfg.png"><br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/tarxzvfpfg.png"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 4.</b> Configure Proofgold by calling the configure 
script. This will create a .proofgold directory in your home directory. 
If you want the directory to be somewhere else, give the alternate 
location by calling configure with <b>-datadir=</b><i>fullpath</i>.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/pfgconfigure.png"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 5.</b> Call make to compile Proofgold and create the proofgold (and proofgoldcli) executables.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/pfgmake.png"><br><br>
      If for some reason your system does not have make, you may be able
 to use the script makebytecode or the script makevmbytecode.
      In some cases the compilation will complain about an inability to 
find Zarith. In that case <b>+zarith</b> must be replaced with a full path to the location of Zarith.
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 6.</b> Create and edit a proofgold.conf file in your .proofgold data directory.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/editproofgoldconf.png"><br><br>
      You will need to include the rpc information for the litecoin node by giving lines of the form<br><br>
      <b>ltcrpcuser=</b><i>ltc rpc username</i><br>
      <b>ltcrpcpass=</b><i>ltc rpc password</i><br>
      If you want your Proofgold node to listen for incoming connections put the ip address on a line of the form<br><br>
      <b>ip=</b><i>ip address</i><br>
      There are many other optional configuration parameters, e.g., to 
control the maximum number of connections, whether the node is staking 
and whether the node is making atomic swaps with litecoin. We do not 
discuss these here to keep the guide brief.
    </p>
    <p><b>Step 7.</b> Start Proofgold for the first time.
      With the default settings, Proofgold will use a recent bootstrap 
(found by looking for bootstrap alert messages broadcast as ltc 
transactions) to populate the database. This process may take an hour or
 two. If it fails or you need to interrupt it, remove completely the 
directory db in the .proofgold directory and try again.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/pfgfirstrun.png"><br><br>
      An alternative to relying on the bootstrap is to add the following line to proofgold.conf:<br><br>
      <b>independentbootstrap=1</b><br><br>
	This is more secure since your node will download and check the 
blockchain so far step by step, but it is likely to take a long time to 
sync with the network.
    </p>

    After passing the initialization phase, you will be in a console in 
which Proofgold commands can be executed. (Proofgold can also be run as a
 daemon by giving the -daemon command line argument. If Proofgold is run
 as a daemon, the commands are given via rpc calls using proofgoldcli.)
    A useful first command is <b>ltcstatus</b>.<br><br>
    <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/pfgpostinit1.png"><br><br>
    <p><b>ltcstatus</b> This shows the outline of all Proofgold blocks burned into the Litecoin blockchain in the past week.
      The first lines printed after <b>ltcstatus</b> will either start with <b>+</b>, <b>*</b> or <b>-</b>. If they start with <b>+</b>, your node is in sync, i.e., has the latest blocks and has validated them. If the lines start with <b>*</b>, then some recent blocks are still being requested from peers or validated. In the unusual case some lines start with <b>-</b>, then some invalid blocks have recently been created.<br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/ltcstatus.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>getpeerinfo</b> The command <b>getpeerinfo</b> gives information about connections to other peers.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/getpeerinfo.png"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>printassets</b> Once your node is in sync, the command <b>printassets</b> should show any assets controlled by your wallet.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/printassets.png"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>reportowned</b> The command <b>reportowned</b> creates a file 
listing all currently objects and propositions. This corresponds to 
which definitions have been made and which theorems have been proven. In
 the case below the created file is called <b>owneduptonow</b>.<br><br>
      <img src="Installation%20Guide%20for%20Proofgold%20on%20Debian_files/reportowned.png"><br><br>
      In a shell we can count the lines, giving a rough estimate of how 
many objects have been defined and how many theorems have been proven. 
The number of lines is roughly double the sum of the number of objects 
defined and the number of theorems proven.<br><br>

    </p>
    There are many other commands. The command <b>help</b> lists them. The command <b>help</b> <i>command</i> gives more information about a specific command.
    In case of trouble note that there is a <b>debug.log</b> file in the
 .proofgold data directory.
    Also, it is possible to register an pseudonymous identity with 
proofgold.org and post to the forum from within the proofgold node. If 
you need further help, feel free to post your questions to the forum.
