    <title>Proofgold: Consensus</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Consensus and How to Stake</h1>
<p>Proofgold uses the litecoin blockchain as an integral part of
its consensus algorithm, and so proofgold must be run in conjunction
with a litecoin node. A node "mines" a proofgold block by burning
some litecoins in a specially formed litecoin burn transaction.
This burn transaction records information about the state of the
proofgold blockchain. Proofgold blocks may also be staked by
combining some proofgold bars in the node's wallet with some burned
litecoins. A difficulty adjustment algorithm targets one proofgold
block per hour.</p>

<p>There is a hard limit of 21 million on the number of proofgold bars
that will be created. This is accomplished by issuing a block reward
of 50 bars for the first 210,000 blocks, with the reward halving
every 210,000 blocks. Each block has a special coinstake transaction
sending half the block reward to the staker of the block and
the other half as a bounty to a pseudorandomly determined proposition.
This bounty can be claimed by the first person (presumably with
an automated theorem prover) to publish a proof of the theorem or
a proof of its negation into the proofgold blockchain.</p>

<p>For more details on reward bounty propositions, see <a href="rewardbounties.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on how to publish proofs, see <a href="publishing.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The following steps explain how to set up a node to stake.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run a litecoin node with txindex=1 and RPC support.
The litecoin.conf file should look something like this:<br>
<textarea>txindex=1
server=1
rpcuser=litecoinrpcusername
rpcpassword=replacewithrealpassword
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
</textarea>
</li>
<li> Create a litecoin segwit address, e.g., using an RPC call
like this:<br>
getnewaddress pfg bech32.<br>
Send some litecoins you intend to burn to this segwit address.
</li>
<li>Install proofgold.<br>
See the proofgold README for more information on this step.
</li>
<li>In the proofgold data directory (probably .proofgold in your
home directory) put a proofgold.conf file with lines like these:<br>
<textarea>ltcrpcuser=litecoinrpcusername
ltcrpcpass=replacewithrealpassword
ltcrpcport=9332
ltcaddress=yourltcsegwitaddress
staking=1
maxburn=maximum_number_of_litoshis_to_burn_at_once
</textarea>
If you run proofgold behind tor you may need to tell
proofgold to use socks and to use curl with socks. For example you can include
these lines in the proofgold.conf file:<br>
<textarea>socks=4
curl=/usr/bin/curl --socks4 127.0.0.1:9050
</textarea>
</li>
<li>Run proofgold.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Some important proofgold commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>ltcstatus</b> shows an outline of the proofgold blocks from
the past week, with the first block being shown being the current best
block. This is a convenient way to check if your node is synced
with the proofgold network.
</li>
<li><b>getpeerinfo</b> shows current connections to the network
</li>
<li><b>nextstakingchances</b> indicates the next time the node will be able
to stake (with various burn amounts) for the next few hours,
assuming no one else creates a block in the meantime.
</li>
<li><b>printassets</b> shows the assets in your wallet.
</li>
</ul>
