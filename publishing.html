<h1>Publishing Documents and Collecting Bounties</h1>

<p>A document is specified by a text file where the first
line has the form:<br>
Document <i>theoryid</i><br>
The <a href="hohf.html">HOHF theory</a> (for all <a href="rewardbounties.html">reward bounties</a>) has id
  6ffc9680fbe00a58d70cdeb319f11205ed998131ce51bb96f16c7904faf74a3d
  so the first line for documents in this theory would be:<br>
Document 6ffc9680fbe00a58d70cdeb319f11205ed998131ce51bb96f16c7904faf74a3d<br>
</p>

<p>The remaining lines are declarations of
local base type names (via Base),
local abbreviations (via Let),
transparent definitions (via Def),
opaque definitions (via Param),
imported known propositions (via Known)
and proven theorems (via Thm).
More information on the assembly style format
for this file can be found <a href="ihol.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>The command <b>readdraft</b> can be used to check
correctness of the file.
Upon publication the publisher will be given ownership of
new definitions
and newly proven propositions.
If the proposition (or its negation) has a bounty,
then the new owner will be able to claim the bounty.
</p>

<p>Once the file with the document is prepared for publication,
the commands <b>addnonce</b> and <b>addpublisher</b> can be used
to include a nonce (so the hash of the document gives
no information about the document before it is published)
and a Proofgold address for the publisher.
The publisher can also optionally include information
about rights for future users to be able to import
opaque defitions and knowns. By default all users
will have the right to make such imports.
</p>

<p>The command <b>commitdraft</b> creates a transaction that
will publish a <b>marker</b> that commits to the current
version of the documents. The document itself can
only be published after the commitment transaction
has been sent and has 12 confirmations.
If the document is modified after the commitment is
published, a new commitment will need to be published.
</p>
  
<p>After the commitment has 12 confirmations,
the command <b>publishdraft</b> creates a publication transaction.
This transaction will also assign the new ownership
information (with corresponding policy on rights to future imports).
</p>
  
<p>After the document has been published, the publisher
may have ownership of propositions with bounties.
The command <b>collectbounties</b> can be used to
ccreate a transaction to collect
all bounties possible.</p>
