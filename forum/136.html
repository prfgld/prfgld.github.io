<div class="posting"><h1>Proofgold Core 0.2.2 / Atomic Swaps</h1>
<p class="author">by <strong><span class="mod registered_user" title="Moderator">BlakeKeiller</span></strong><span class="interpunction">, </span>Saturday, January 02, 2021, 13:12 <span class="ago">(337 days ago)</span></p>
<p>Here is Proofgold Core 0.2.2:</p>
<p><a href="https://proofgold.org/proofgold-core-0.2.2.tgz">https://proofgold.org/proofgold-core-0.2.2.tgz</a></p>
<p>There are only a few changes from 0.2.1. Most of these changes are bug fixes to the swapping code. For example, the price of a sell offer for a node was being represented as floats and a side effect was that when stopping and restarting the node the price would decrease slightly due to approximation issues. It's now being saved as an int64. Also there was a bug when a sell offer was matched. Instead of removing the sell offer after matching it would actually remove every other sell offer.</p>
<p>If you aren't using the swapping code from 0.2.1 it's not vital to update to 0.2.2.</p>
<p>If you are using the swapping code from 0.2.1, I'd recommend calling &quot;cancelswapselloffers&quot; before upgrading and then using &quot;createswapselloffer&quot; to recreate your sell offers after upgrading.</p>
<p>If you want to have your node participate in atomic swaps, you need to add</p>
<p>swapping=1</p>
<p>to your proofgold.conf file.</p>
<p>The relevant commands are:</p>
<p>selloffers (prints the local sell offers of the node)<br />
buyoffers (prints all known buy offers seen by scanning the ltc chain)<br />
matchoffers (shows current match offers as seen by scanning the pfg chain)<br />
swapredemptions (shows swap redemptions in progress)</p>
<p>createswapselloffer (create a local unadvertised offer to sell some pfg bars for litecoins)<br />
cancelswapselloffers (delete all local sell offers of the node)<br />
createswapbuyoffer (make a special ltc tx that offers to buy some pfg bars for litecoins)<br />
cancelswapbuyoffer (cancel a specific buy offer -- this spends the ltc utxo created by createswapbuyoffer back to yourself)<br />
scanforswapbuyoffers (this isn't needed but can scan back in the ltc chain some number of blocks in case there was a buy offer missed or created before the node started swapping)</p>
<p>There is more information about each command available by using help with the command.</p>
<p>I've been trying to keep at least one sell order for 10-100 pfg bars at a price of 0.00015 litecoins (which was about 1 eurocent per bar, but maybe now it's more like 1.5 eurocents) as a &quot;faucet.&quot; Going through my debug.log file I see 3 atomic swaps that have happened resulting in roughly 290 bars being swapped for about 0.04 ltc.</p>
<p>I'm now switching to a default sell offer of 1-10 bars at a price of 0.0015 as a &quot;faucet.&quot; I'll make other sell offers and look to manually match buy offers I see depending on how I feel at the time.</p>
